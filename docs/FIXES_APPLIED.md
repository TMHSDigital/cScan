# cScan Safety Assessment Fixes

## Issue Identified
The safety assessment was being too aggressive and marking all files as "critical", preventing any deletions.

## Root Causes
1. **Overly broad critical path matching**: Using substring matching (`if any(critical in filepath for critical in self.critical_paths)`) was catching too many files
2. **Running process protection too aggressive**: Every directory containing a running executable was marked as critical
3. **File-in-use check failing**: Non-existent test files were being marked as "in use"

## Fixes Applied

### 1. **Improved Critical Path Detection**
- Changed from substring matching to proper path prefix matching
- Only protect actual Windows system directories, not all user app directories
- Removed overly broad Microsoft folder protection in user space

```python
# Before: if any(critical in filepath for critical in self.critical_paths)
# After: Proper startswith() check on normalized paths
for critical_path in self.critical_paths:
    if path_lower.startswith(critical_path):
        return 'critical'
```

### 2. **Smarter Running Process Protection**
- Only protect executables in actual system directories
- Don't mark entire app directories as critical just because an app is running

### 3. **Better Safety Categorization**
- More specific patterns for safe files (cache, temp, crashdumps)
- Added specific safe locations (pip cache, npm cache, game caches)
- Proper path separators in patterns to avoid false matches

### 4. **Fixed File-in-Use Detection**
- Check if file exists before trying to open it
- Better error handling to distinguish between "file not found" and "file locked"

### 5. **Enhanced File Categorization**
- Separated .exe files into appropriate categories (installers vs system vs executables)
- Added crashdumps as a separate category
- Better handling of files without extensions

### 6. **Improved Smart Suggestions**
- Prioritize safe deletions (cache files, old temp files)
- Sort suggestions by safety level and size
- More categories: crashdumps, old installers, large media files

### 7. **Added Safety Controls**
- `dry_run_mode`: Test what would be deleted without actually deleting
- `override_safety`: Allow advanced users to override safety checks (dangerous!)
- `use_recycle_bin`: Send to recycle bin instead of permanent deletion (default: true)

## Result
The safety assessment now correctly identifies:
- **[SAFE] Safe files**: Cache, temp, crashdumps in appropriate locations
- **[USER] User files**: Downloads, documents, media files requiring confirmation  
- **[UNKN] Unknown files**: Files that don't match clear patterns
- **[CRIT] Critical files**: True system files and actively used files

Files are no longer incorrectly marked as critical, while still protecting important system files and data.
